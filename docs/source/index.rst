Welcome to Layover Connection's documentation!
===================================

MVC todo
**TODO** 
1.	Build an App interface where solo travelers can sign up and check in to the O'hare Airport
2.	Give users a simple option and scroll menu to announce how long they have to spend in the city.
-	Create an active session whenever the user creates this session.
-	Have the app limit the user to one session at a time
-	Create a check before they create an open session to see if there is still an active session open by someone else at that airport already. If there is then notify the user that someoneâ€™s open to meet. If they still feel like creating a separate session give them the option to. 
3.	Have the app display how many users or open sessions there are in the airport at the same time.
4.	Give any of the users the option to quickly post what they want to do in the city if they have time to explore: ie: check out a place to eat hit up a bar etc.
